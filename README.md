# Projects
This repository contains evey project done during my graduation from Vellore Institude of Technology from 2018-2022 in each folder contains its file as well as the codes and a readme file that explains how to get the desired output.

## [Accounting System for small scale businesses](https://github.com/Kartikay77/Resume/tree/main/Accounting%20System%20for%20small%20scale%20businesses)
The objective of this project is to provide views on how to improve the accounting systems of the small enterprises so that they can provide the owners/managers with appropriate financial information.

## [Comparative Study and Analysis of AES and DES Algorithms on Various Multimedia Platforms.](https://github.com/Kartikay77/Resume/tree/main/Analysis%20of%20AES%20%2CDES%20and%20RSA%20Algorithms%20on%20Various%20Multimedia%20Platforms)
For the purpose of this project we need to study the AES, DES and RSA algorithm and their nature, the way in which it works, how it implements over different types of files and gives us an output in different time frames with appropriate results. 

## [LRU-K USING HASH TABLE AND DOUBLY LINKED LIST](https://github.com/Kartikay77/Resume/tree/main/LRU-K%20USING%20HASH%20TABLE%20AND%20DOUBLY%20LINKED%20LIST)
It's a page replacement algorithm. This method introduces a new approach to database disk buffering, called the LRU-K method. The basic idea of LRU-K is to keep track of the times of the last K references to popular database pages, using this information to statistically estimate the inter arrival times of references on a page by page basis.

## [MORSE CODE ENCODER](https://github.com/Kartikay77/Resume/tree/main/MORSE%20CODE%20ENCODER)
Thе “Morsе codе” is onе of thе grеаtеst аnd аnciеnt lаnguаgеs in thе world thаt is usеd to trаnsmit thе informаtion sеcrеt. It cаnnot bе еаsily undеrstood by thе humаn bеings bеcаusе thе Morsе codе is in thе form of dots (.) аnd dаsh (-) formаt.

## [Smith-Waterman Algorithm in OpenMP](https://github.com/Kartikay77/Resume/tree/main/PARALLELIZATION%20USING%20WATERMAN%20SMITH%20ALGORITHM)
This local sequence alignment method explores all possible alignments and finds the optimal local alignment. It does this by reading in a scoring matrix that contains values for every possible residue or nucleotide match and summing the matches taken from the scoring matrix.

## [Heart disease analysis and prediction system](https://github.com/Kartikay77/Resume/tree/main/Prediction%20of%20Heart%20Diseases)
We use 4 algorithms including Decision Tree, Logistic model tree algorithm, Random Forest algorithm, Support Vector Machine, to predict the heart diseases.

## [Smart Farming using IoT](https://github.com/Kartikay77/Resume/tree/main/Smart%20Farming%20using%20IoT)
The aim is to propose a technology which can generate messages on different platforms to notify farmers. The product will assist farmers by getting live data (Temperature, humidity, soil moisture, UV index, IR) from the farmland to take necessary steps to enable them to do smart farming by also increasing their crop yields and saving resources (water, fertilizers).

## [TACKLE PROBLEMS OF CYBER SECURITY IN SOCIAL NETWORKS](https://github.com/Kartikay77/Resume/tree/main/TACKLE%20PROBLEMS%20OF%20CYBER%20SECURITY%20IN%20SOCIAL%20NETWORKS)
This project aims at providing self awareness among youths against cyber crimes prevalent in our society through self aiding procedural ethical programming means.

## [Word-Prediction-System](https://github.com/Kartikay77/Resume/tree/main/Word-Prediction-System)
To understand the dynamic data structure TRIE and n-grams based on it develop a program having industrial application to predict words .

## [ONLINE CAB MANAGEMENT SYSTEM](https://github.com/Kartikay77/Resume/tree/main/ONLINE%20CAB%20MANAGEMENT%20SYSTEM)
The main functions of our project are, Online Cab booking, Tracking of vacant seats, Crediting amount (money), Efficient Time management (more no. of cabs during busy hours in a day)

## [SENTIMENT ANALYSIS OF TEXT EMOTION ON TWITTER](https://github.com/Kartikay77/Resume/tree/main/snlp_SENTIMENT%20ANALYSIS%20OF%20TEXT%20EMOTION%20ON%20TWITTER)
The novelty in our project lies in the use of a hybrid-based approach for sentiment analysis. We have not only checked the success rate of different algorithms but also implemented an algorithm to our own understanding and incorporated an aspect that allows us to judge Sentiment in the tweets.

## [MARIAL PARASITE DETECTION SYSTEM](https://github.com/Kartikay77/Resume/tree/main/MARIAL%20PARASITE%20DETECTION%20SYSTEM)
In this we take indian dataset for finding malaria infection in blood cell of humans and predicting with the help of residual netwok wherther malaria is present in blood cell or not.
