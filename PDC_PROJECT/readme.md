## How to Use
### Serial Version
* Compile the project
    
    ```bash
    gcc serial_smithW.c -o serial_smithW -fopenmp -DDEBUG
    ```
* Run the program:
    
    ```bash
    ./serial_smithW <number_of_col> <number_of_rows>
    ```

### Parallel Version
* Compile the project
    
    ```bash
    gcc omp_smithW.c -o omp_smithW -fopenmp -DDEBUG
    ```
* Run the program:
    
    ```bash
    ./omp_smithW <number_of_threads> <number_of_col> <number_of_rows>
    ```
