## Smart Farming using IoT, a cheap solution for optimally monitoring farming conditions
To program the NodeMCU for Smart Irrigation System, plug the NodeMCU to your laptop with a Micro USB Cable and open Arduino IDE. In this program, only the Adafruit MQTT library is used as an external library. You can download the library from here:

Adafruit_MQTT.h

To program NodeMCU with Arduino IDE go to File–>Perferences–>Settings.
