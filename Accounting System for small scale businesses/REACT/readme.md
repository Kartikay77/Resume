We have implemented an salary management module for our main accounting
system, where we can log salary out for all our employees. That will make it
easier for us to see how much money going out in salary and also daily, monthly
and yearly views.
• Using this it will be easier to manage outgoing salaries of employees.
• We can enter daily salaries and it will show how much we have paid monthly or yearly.
• Thus giving us a proper estimate of the moneyflow
